## NASA POWER Radiation Visualization

This project slices NASA POWER data and produces regional mean surface radiation maps
(Longwave & Shortwave). The image below shows the averaged data from 2024-10-19 to 2025-10-19 for the defined
bounding box (35°N–45°N, 85°W–75°W).

The color bar on the right of the ALLSKY_LW_DWN shows how much Longwave radiation energy(infrared heat form clouds and the atmosphere) reaches the surface measured in Watts per square meter. In the case of ALLSKY_SW_DWN it is the amount of Shortwave radiation hitting the surface(Sunlight or solar energy). 

This data could be used to estimate solar power potential, or to compare actual satellite observations to model predictions.
