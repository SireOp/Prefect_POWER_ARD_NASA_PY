## NASA POWER Radiation Visualization

This project slices NASA POWER data and produces regional mean surface radiation maps
(Longwave & Shortwave). The image below shows the averaged data from 2024-10-19 to 2025-10-19 for the defined
bounding box (35°N–45°N, 85°W–75°W).

The color bars on the right of each plot represent the measured radiation in Watts per square meter (W/m²). ALLSKY_LW_DWN shows how much Longwave radiation energy(infrared heat form clouds and the atmosphere) reaches the surface, while ALLSKY_SW_DWN is the amount of Shortwave radiation hitting the surface(Sunlight or solar energy). 

This data could be used to estimate solar power potential, or to compare satellite observations against model predictions.
